# EdgeDetector
This is an image edge detector that is written in C. It takes a P6 file as its input and applys a laplacian filter to it which has only the edges of the input image. It will then output a new image that has everything done to it as previously mentioned. There is a directory that contains an input and output image to display what the program does better.
